Bids can be placed on any lot offered for sale where you see the bid button. When you have logged in, to view all the lots in a sale click on the “Click here to view lots and place bids” icon under the sale detail. All the items in the sale will then be displayed in lot number order. Select the lot you are interested in and place your offer in the enter auto bid screen. Once you have entered your bid you will be asked to confirm your bid and confirm that you have read and agreed to all the terms and conditions relating to the sale. You will then be sent an e-mail detailing the item you have offered on and confirming the amount bid.
There are two main ways of bidding in an online auction sale. <br>
<ul>
<li>	The Auto bid system allows you to place the maximum price you are willing to pay for the lot. The auction software will then bid automatically on your behalf up to that amount as other bids come in.</li>
<li>	Incremental bidding is where you place the next incremental bid stated for a lot. (Bidding increment values will vary depending on the item). After placing and confirming your incremental bid you will be notified as to whether your bid is high enough to meet the reserve, or another user has placed an auto bid on the lot.</li></ul><br>
All online auction sales have an allocated finishing time; however, if any bidding occurs in the final 2 minutes of the sale overtime bidding will occur. When any bid is placed the end time will extend by a further 5 minutes. Further bids will not extend the end time unless placed in the final 2 minutes. Overtime bidding is used as with a fixed cut off time the item is sold to the bidder who clicks the bid button last, whereas with overtime bidding the item is sold to the bidder who is willing to pay the highest amount.
